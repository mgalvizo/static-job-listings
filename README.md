## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

### What I learned

I learned to extend styles of other styled-components in order to reuse some of them.

I used the ```every()``` method for the filtering logic to check if every added filter is included in a collection that contains the relevant tags of each job listing.

### Useful resources

-   [Styled Components Documentation](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#extending-styles) - This helped me with the implementation of extending other styled-component styles.
